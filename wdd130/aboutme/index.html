    <h2>Chad Carpenter</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Chad Carpenter. I am a Computer information Technologies Major. After a few classes
     I've taken I want to maybe swap into a programming major so I'm here taking this class. My only hobby is
     videogames which is why I love technology so much. 
    </p>
    <p>This will be my first web design class so I'm excited to learn more. I'm really liking the feel of BYUI
        and how nice people are here. I went to Eastern Arizona College before here to get an Associates in 
        General Courses and the feel from this school is much different. I am from Arizona and haven't lived 
        anywhere else for an extended period of time so I'm used to the heat but not the cold.
    </p>
    <p>I am Introverted in person but I hope that I can learn a lot from this class and everyone in it!</p>
